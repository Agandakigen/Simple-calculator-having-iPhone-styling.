The code I provided is an HTML document with an embedded JavaScript code for a scientific calculator. It consists of an input field for displaying the calculator's output and a set of buttons for performing mathematical operations. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

The HTML structure defines a calculator interface with a display input field and a set of buttons.
The CSS styles (defined in the <style> tags or an external CSS file) handle the visual appearance of the calculator.
The JavaScript code (included through the <script> tag or an external JS file) implements the calculator's functionality.
In the JavaScript code:

The display variable references the display input field by its ID.
The ansValue variable is used to store the previous answer.
The forEach loop adds a click event listener to each button on the calculator.
When a button is clicked, the corresponding value is obtained from the button's text content.
The current value in the display input field is retrieved using display.value.
The code uses a switch statement to handle different button values and perform the appropriate operations.
For the '=' button, the code attempts to evaluate the expression in the display using eval(). If successful, the result is displayed, and the ansValue variable is updated.
For the 'C' button, the display is cleared.
For the 'âˆš' button, the square root of the current display value is calculated and displayed.
For the 'x^2' button, the square of the current display value is calculated and displayed.
For the 'Ans' button, the previous answer (ansValue) is displayed.
For other buttons (numbers and operators), the corresponding value is appended to the display value.
Note that using eval() to evaluate user input can be risky and might lead to security vulnerabilities. It is generally recommended to use safer alternatives for evaluating expressions.
